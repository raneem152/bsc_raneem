image processing opencv project:
this code takes 2 images for the same thing current &past images.
and compare the images by drawing rectangles with green colour to detect the diffrence in colour.
and the rectangles with blue colour detect the dffrence in shape .
the user creating the rectangles by draging with mouse clicks.

code:
first importing libraries 
then defining the list of coordinates of the rectangles.
then [rectangle_shape(event,x,y,flag,param)] function to draw the rectangles :
  1) green rectangles to detect the diffrence in colour by dragging left button.
  2) blue rectangle to detect the diffrence in shape by dragging right button.
this function drawing the rectangles deppends on the first click which represent the start point of the rectangle and the last click which represent the end point of(width, hight)

then the part of printing the options for the user 

then reading the 2 images and store it in 2 variables and take a coppy from the current image to drag rectangles on it
 and show the images after resizing 

then the while loop which will break if the user press q to exit the program and terminate



division of task:

we write the code during a zoom meeting and test it
