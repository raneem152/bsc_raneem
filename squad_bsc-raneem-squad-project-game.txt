task 3 in arduino --> robot that is controlled via Bluetooth and the robot will have to move forward, move backward, rotate clockwise, and counter-clockwise. This project is a Squad project
components used in ciruit 1- arduino uno  2-HC-05 Bluetooth module    3- 4 5v volt DC motor   4-L298N Motor driver
The HC-05 Bluetooth Module is discussed first in terms of the circuit's design. The Bluetooth module's +5V and GND pins are linked to the Arduino's +5V and GND.
motor driver is connected to the arduino as an inputs during the pins and with 4 motors as an output ,as its connected to ground an vcc 5 volt
Bluetooth module connecting the tx with rx ,and vcc 5 volt and ground
Since I will be only transmitting data related to the Robotâ€™s movement from Android Phone to Bluetooth Module and do not intend to receive any data from Arduino,
I will connect only the TX pin of the Bluetooth Module to RX Pin of Arduino


we wrote the code as a squad during zoom meeting
