task 3 in arduino --> robot that is controlled via Bluetooth and the robot will have to move forward, move backward, rotate clockwise, and counter-clockwise. This project is a Squad project
components used in ciruit 1- arduino uno  2-HC-05 Bluetooth module    3- 4 5v volt DC motor   4-L298N Motor driver
The HC-05 Bluetooth Module is discussed first in terms of the circuit's design. The Bluetooth module's +5V and GND pins are linked to the Arduino's +5V and GND.
motor driver is connected to the arduino as an inputs during the pins and with 4 motors as an output ,as its connected to ground an vcc 5 volt
Bluetooth module connecting the tx with rx ,and vcc 5 volt and ground
Since I will be only transmitting data related to the Robotâ€™s movement from Android Phone to Bluetooth Module and do not intend to receive any data from Arduino,
I will connect only the TX pin of the Bluetooth Module to RX Pin of Arduino



code-->
first including softwareserial.h library to control the car via bluetooth 
then define the pins of wheels to control the car movement (PINS : IN1-> 12 , IN2-> 11 , IN3-> 10 , IN4-> 9)
each pin control a wheel of car (IN1: right forward wheel , IN2 : right backward wheel , IN3 : left forward wheel , IN4: left bakward wheel)
convert the pins of  TX & RX form default pins (0 , 1) to pins (2 , 3)
then define the string of data that tha user  will enter in a string type and the btVal is the integer value of the data to be compared in the switch cases


functions of movement:
1- void forward():
this function will move the car forward by turning on the 2 motors in the forward wheels (IN1 , IN3)
and turning off the 2 backward motors(IN2 , IN4)

2-void reverse():
this function will move the car backward by turning on the 2 motors in the backward wheels (IN2 , IN4)
and turning off the 2 forward motors(IN1 , IN3)

3- void left():
this function will rotate the car anticlockwise by turning on the motor of the left forward wheel (IN3)
and turning off the motors of other wheels

4- void right():
this function will rotate the car clockwise by turning on the motor of the right forward wheel (IN1)
and turning off the motors of other wheels

5- void stoprobot():
this function will stor the movment of car by turinig off the motors of all car wheels.


->  [void setup()] function:  
define the pin modes of pins that will control the car 
then, turning off all the motors of wheels by (digitalwrite a low signal to the pins of motors of wheels)
then begin the serial with band 9600

->  [void loop()] function:
the while loop will run only if the user enter an input via bluetooth
, else if the user didn't enter an input that's mean no bluetooth data 
and each loop storing the input in the data variable of string type
then convert data string to int and stor it on btVal variable

then compare the int value of btVal by using switch cases (1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5)
each case will call a function of funtions control the movement of car 
case 1 means "FORWARD" so it will call [void forward()] function to move the car forward
case 2 means "REVERSE" so it will call [void reverse()] function to mvoe the car backward
case 3 means "LEFT" so it will call [void left()] function to rotate the car anticlockwise
case 4 means "RIGHT" so it will call [void right()] function to rotate the car clockwise
case 5 means "STOP" so it will call [void stop()] function to stop the movement of tha car

 khloud--> software serial part & loop() 
 all the project discussed in a zoom meeting will upload in slack channel
